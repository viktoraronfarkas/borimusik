        Hi, I'm Viktor, a 23-year-old hungarian techno artist, who lives in Vienna currently. I've been involved in
        music since I was little, I started playing the piano in elementary school, then moved on to the guitar which I
        played for around 8 years.

        When I moved to Budapest, I got introduced to the techno scene, and started fucking
        around with FL Studio. Since then, I have been producing music as a hobby, slowly getting better and upgrading
        my gear. I currently have a Behringer TD-03 and an oldschool Casio PT-31 in my posession, which I am absolutely
        in love with.

        I am really into hardtechno, hardstyle, gabber, acid techno and ghettotek, I get my inspiration mostly from
        these genres. My music is energetic, heavy, hard, usually involves a touch of acid on the side. I love using
        heavy distorted kicks and trance synths. If this sounds like something you would listen to, check out
        my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4o3bLvdMFH6MiBvdfrGVY2?si=s42N6ka8Q8OUtT0l_rUgsg">Spotify</a>
